Back then, it described the planned use of violence and brutality to scare people, with the goal of pushing a specific political or social idea. Today, terrorism can be seen in many different forms and contexts, used by various groups to spread fear.\n","\n","Although the United Nations Security Council agrees that terrorism is a threat to peace and security, it hasn't provided a clear definition of what terrorism is in its resolutions.

Different definitions of terrorism prioritize various characteristics, reflecting the concerns of the respective authorities.\n","\n","In the past decade, terrorism has resulted in an average of 26,000 fatalities annually worldwide. The global death toll from terrorism fluctuated, reaching its highest at 44,600 in 2014 and declining to 8,200 in 2011. In 2017, terrorism accounted for 0.05% of global deaths. Geographically, terrorism exhibits a significant concentration, with 95% of fatalities in 2019 occurring in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. Although terrorism typically represents less than 0.01% of deaths in most countries, in regions marked by high levels of conflict, it can constitute several percent of fatalities.\n","\n","While airline hijackings were once commonplace, they are now exceedingly rare. Nonetheless, public apprehension about terrorism remains substantial, with surveys indicating that more than half of respondents in many countries express concerns about becoming victims. Media coverage of terrorism often surpasses its frequency and share of fatalities, contributing to perceptions that may not accurately reflect the relative risk posed by terrorism compared to other threats.\n","\n","### When I study terrorism, I often use the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) as a key source for information on terrorist incidents and deaths worldwide.
