# Poject-On-Global-Terrorism

As a security expert, my goal is to identify areas where terrorism is a big problem and figure out what kinds of weapons terrorists are using. I also want to know which terrorist groups are the most active. By doing what's called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I can look at a lot of data and spot patterns or trends that might help us understand security issues better.

Why am I doing this project? I want to study different theories and real-world data to better understand things like war, security, and peace. By doing this, I hope to get a good grasp on the challenges we face today, like environmental problems and how women's safety is linked to security. This will help me analyze security and terrorism issues more effectively.

# What is Terrorism

The word "terrorism" comes from "terror," which means "great fear." It started being used during the French Revolution in 1795. Back then, it meant scaring people using violence to support a certain political or social idea. Nowadays, terrorism shows up in many forms and places, scaring people for different reasons.

Even though the United Nations Security Council agrees that terrorism is a problem for peace and safety, it hasn't given a clear definition of what terrorism is. Instead, it lets each country decide what terrorism means in its own laws. So, different countries have different ideas about what counts as terrorism and who is a terrorist.

# Through this project, we want to look at and understand these things:

What are the places where terrorism is most common? 

Why do countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan have a tense relationship?

How bad were the Boko Haram attacks in Nigeria?

Let's also check out the Naxalism patterns in Indian states. What security problems and ideas can we find by looking at the data?

This dataset records terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2017.

The "country" column has a code for each country, and the "country_txt" column shows the name of the country.

The "region" column has a code for each region, and the "region_txt" column shows the name of the region.

The "provstate" column shows the state affected within the country, and the "city" column lists the cities within that state that were attacked by terrorists.

The "latitude" and "longitude" columns give the exact location where the attacks happened. The "vicinity" column describes how close the attack was to nearby areas.

The "location" column tells us where the attacks took place, while the "summary" column gives a quick overview of the attack, including the date, type of attack, number of terrorists involved, types of weapons used, targets, and damages caused.

The "alternative" column shows how many other attacks happened on the same day, and the "alternative_txt" column describes what type of attacks they were.

The "success" column has either 0 or 1, indicating if the attack was successful or not. The "suicide" column tells us how many terrorists died if it was a suicide attack.

The "attacktype1," "attacktype2," and "attacktype3" columns show codes for the type of attack. The "attacktype1_txt" column tells us what each code means, like Assassination or Bombing/Explosion.

The "targtype1" column shows codes for the type of targets, and the "targtype1_txt" column tells us what each code represents, such as Government or Business.

The "gname" column shows the name of the terrorist group responsible for the attack. The "motive" column explains why the attack was carried out.

The "individual" column indicates whether the terrorist acted alone or as part of a group.

The "weaptype1," "weaptype2," and "weaptype3" columns indicate the types of weapons used in the terrorist attacks. The "weaptype1_txt," "weaptype2_txt," and "weaptype3_txt" columns provide the names of these weapon types, like Explosives or Firearms.

Similarly, the "weapsubtype1," "weapsubtype2," and "weapsubtype3" columns give subtypes of the weapons used, and the corresponding "_txt" columns provide the names of these subtypes, such as Pipe Bomb or Handgun.

The "weapdetail" column gives additional details about the weapons used in the attack.

We think that talking openly, fair government rules, and fixing problems from the beginning can stop terrorism. We, as future data experts, are studying why these awful acts happen and how they affect people.

# Conclusion

1. The number of attacks has increased, but not every attack results in a high number of casualties.

2. Iraq has the highest number of terrorist attacks.

3. The Middle East and North Africa are the most targeted regions for terrorist attacks.

4. Most terrorist attacks involve bombings or explosions.

5. The majority of attacks are aimed at private citizens and property.

6. Taliban and ISIL are among the most active terrorist organizations.

7. The trend analysis shows a significant increase in global terrorist attacks since 1971. Terrorist groups like ISIL, Taliban, Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, and NPA have contributed to this trend. However, there's been a slight decrease in attacks in recent times.

8. Every human life is valuable, and we must do everything possible to combat terrorism and those who fund it. The best long-term solutions are social, economic, and educational development.

9. It's crucial to raise awareness among the general public about the threat of terrorism.

#  Solution to Business Objective

1. The Middle East and North Africa are the most frequently targeted regions, so their governments should strengthen their defense and investigation agencies, and restrict access to materials used for bombings and explosions.
 
2. Iraq is the most targeted country, so its government should reinforce its defense and investigation departments, and restrict access to bomb-making materials.

3. Increase public awareness about the threat of terrorism.

4. Anti-terrorism organizations and defense agencies should closely monitor Taliban and ISIL, which are the most active terrorist groups.

5. The international community should establish stronger laws and take decisive action against terrorism.
